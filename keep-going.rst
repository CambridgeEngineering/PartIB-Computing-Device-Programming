A more complex program
----------------------

The code below exploits a useful inclusion in your development board, a push button!





The line:


indicates that the variable xxx is linked to the physical pin that happen to be associated with the push button. 
When pressed it is true (1) and false (0) otherwise. By assigning its value to the LED, we can control the LED with the button.

The movie clip below explains some of this using external LED and switch. Look at it if you would like more information.

.. admonition:: Exercise
	Would you be able to edit the code so that the blue LED is on when the button is pressed, but the red LED is on when the button is not pressed?
