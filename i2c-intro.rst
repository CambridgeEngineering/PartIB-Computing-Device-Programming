I2C is the protocols used during IDP to link your different boards together.





How to connect a device?

- Understand how to set the different parameters of the device to get it to do what you want

- Request and read data from the device.




Reading the spec sheet

This is daunting document! It contains many words you are not familiar.
However, you probably don't need to understand it all to get to use the device in your application.
