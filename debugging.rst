Debugging
=========



Debugging is an important part of programming. 
Due to the lack of interfaces such as screen or sounds, one relies by default on the basic LEDs to investigate program errors. 
But luckily it is also possible, with a bit of extra effort, to establish text communications with the computer through the USB connection.
 
In this section, we will explore different types or errors, and techniques to detect them and try to address them.

There is a lot of information online on this topic!

Errors
------

- Compile time errors

- Execution time errors


Communications between the computer and the microcontroller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is more advanced, but really useful once you get it to work.

- Using printf, or 
- the serial port.
