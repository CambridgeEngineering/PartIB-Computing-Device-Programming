Connecting and testing the device
=================================



Connecting the device
---------------------

Hopefully you found already that the default pins for I\ :sup:`2`\ C communication on your microcontroller board are 

Use the jumper wires to connect VCC and GND, as well as SDA and SCL to the pins D14 and D15.



Testing that the device is able to communicate and check its address
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The code below will help you test communications with your device.
It scans all I\ :sup:`2`\ C addresses on the bus connected to the default I\ :sup:`2`\ C pins.
For each address, it tries to read something.
If it manages to find a device, it returns the address on the serial port so that you can catch it on your terminal.
It also uses led flashes to communicate visually the address.

   **Paste the code below in a new project on the mbed compiler. Compile it and place it on your board. Check the that device address returned matches to address set to the device after soldering the pads.**


.. code-block:: c

	I2C i2c(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);

			// Note that while I2C addresses are from 1-127 we need to left-shift one bit

Getting your first temperature measurements
-------------------------------------------


.. admonition:: Task

   **Start a new project, and select the template called** *Read external LM75 temperature sensor using I2C master*. **The code below should now be available to you. Compile it and try it on your board. You will need to catch the serial output to read the temperature.**


.. code-block:: c

	#include "mbed.h"
	 
	#define LM75_REG_TEMP (0x00) // Temperature Register
	#define LM75_REG_CONF (0x01) // Configuration Register
	#define LM75_ADDR     (0x90) // LM75 address
	 
	I2C i2c(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);
	 
	DigitalOut myled(LED1);
	 
	Serial pc(SERIAL_TX, SERIAL_RX);
	 
	volatile char TempCelsiusDisplay[] = "+abc.d C";
	 
	int main()
	{
	 
		char data_write[2];
		char data_read[2];
	 
		/* Configure the Temperature sensor device STLM75:
		- Thermostat mode Interrupt
		- Fault tolerance: 0
		*/
		data_write[0] = LM75_REG_CONF;
		data_write[1] = 0x02;
		int status = i2c.write(LM75_ADDR, data_write, 2, 0);
		if (status != 0) { // Error
			while (1) {
				myled = !myled;
				wait(0.2);
			}
		}
	 
		while (1) {
			// Read temperature register
			data_write[0] = LM75_REG_TEMP;
			i2c.write(LM75_ADDR, data_write, 1, 1); // no stop
			i2c.read(LM75_ADDR, data_read, 2, 0);
	 
			// Calculate temperature value in Celcius
			int tempval = (int)((int)data_read[0] << 8) | data_read[1];
			tempval >>= 7;
			if (tempval <= 256) {
				TempCelsiusDisplay[0] = '+';
			} else {
				TempCelsiusDisplay[0] = '-';
				tempval = 512 - tempval;
			}
	 
			// Decimal part (0.5Â°C precision)
			if (tempval & 0x01) {
				TempCelsiusDisplay[5] = 0x05 + 0x30;
			} else {
				TempCelsiusDisplay[5] = 0x00 + 0x30;
			}
	 
			// Integer part
			tempval >>= 1;
			TempCelsiusDisplay[1] = (tempval / 100) + 0x30;
			TempCelsiusDisplay[2] = ((tempval % 100) / 10) + 0x30;
			TempCelsiusDisplay[3] = ((tempval % 100) % 10) + 0x30;
	 
			// Display result
			pc.printf("temp = %s\n", TempCelsiusDisplay);
			myled = !myled;
			wait(1.0);
		}
	 
	}
	 

This code is fairly complex, and it will be difficult to understand what it does at a glance.
To understand what happens with the different registers, you will need to dive into the sensor data sheet
and study what the different registers are for, and how to use them to configure the device.

You can certainly give it a go now, but we will tell you more about this at the start of Easter vacation...
