Tutorial
========

**Introduction**


This part of the device programming activity can be done as soon as
the boards are in your hands.  Watch a few videos (curated from the
web), learn about the general programming approach, and get the LEDs
to blink!

You will then think again about how to use functions in your programs,
and learn how to use the push button integrated with the board.

The debugging section will make sure you are familiar with what
happens when you make errors. It is quite difficult to understand what
problems you have when you don't have a screen to tell what the
problem is.

Many people find it useful to pass text to the computer connected to
the board for debugging purpose. While the corresponding
microcontroller code is easy, it is more difficult to configure your
computer to get it to work. See if you can make it work, but don't
panic if you can't!


**Requirements**


#. STM32F746 STMicroelectronics development board (provided)
#. Micro-USB to USB cable
#. Computer with web browser, internet connection and USB port available.
