Device programming activity
---------------------------

Why such an activity?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Across all branches of Engineering, the use of sensor networks and
embedded computation has become ubiquitous.  Whether you look at the
building industry, transportation or biomedical engineering, networks
of interconnected sensors able to process and communicate data are
increasingly involved in the control and diagnostic of complex
operations.  This technological trend has now reached most corners of
not only industrial processes, but also personal life, encompassed by
the fairly generic expression of Internet of Things.

The modern Engineer must therefore embrace this ubiquity, and make
sure that whatever their specialisation is, they master the basic
aspects of sensing and communication.  This series of practical
activities is here to fill this gap and provide engineering students
with the computational and experimental skills to approach with more
confidence the development of simple embedded devices to perform
common tasks.  The tasks selected cover the basic operations of a
common ARM based microcontroller.  Once familiar with a
microcontroller, you will soon appreciate that they are all similar,
and that your new skills are amazingly transferable.


A few words about sponsors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This activity has been made possible by two sponsors.

- ARM and STMicroelectronics have donated the Nucleo microcontrollers used in this lab. We are very grateful to them.
  
- The University of Cambridge provided financial support through a
  Teaching And Learning Innovation Fund to run a number of student
  projects and promote the use of Open Source tools in undergraduate
  education. This grant currently covers the cost of the 3rd year (IIA) project
  GM2, Technology for the poorest billion, as well as part of the
  running costs of this second year activity.
