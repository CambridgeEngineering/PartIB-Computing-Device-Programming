Device Programming activity
-----------------------

Why such activity?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accross all branches of Engineering, the use of sensor networks and embedded computation has become ubiquitous. 
Whether you look at the building industry, transportation or biomedical engineering, networks of interconnected sensors able to process and communicate data are increasingly involved in the control and diagnostoc of complex operations.
This technological trend has now reached most corner of not only industrial processes, but also personal life, encompassed by the fairly generic expression of Internet of Things. Internet of Things

The modern engineering must therefore embrasse this ubiquity, and make sure that whatever their specialisation is, they master the basic aspects of sensing and communication.
This practical series of activities is here to fill this gap and deliver all part I Engineers with the computational and experimental skills to approach with more confidence the development of simple embedded device to perform common tasks.
The tasks selected cover the basic operations of a common ARM based microcontroller.
Once familiar with a microcontroller, you will soon appreciate that they are all similar, and that your skill are amazingly transferable.


This activity is not meant to stop in the at the end of the last exercise, and take place in the confinement of the DPO.
Alongside the knowledge and experience, you will get to take away and keep the hardware - a fairly powerful and generic microcontroller.
This is to enable you to reuse and expend your skills wherever the curriculum will take you next year, and beyond.
Feel free to reuse in your personal or academic projects, get yourself more sensors, actuators, exchange tips with each other.
Some of you already have impressive skills - share this expertise and work with each other.
You will find also that there is a vibrant international community combining hobbyists, academics, students and industrialists working together extend day after day the remit of such hardware projects.
A lot of this is made possible by the use, reuse and modification of Open Source software and hardware.
The success and social impact companies like `Arduino <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino>`_ speaks for itself, not only in schools or hobbyists, but also as a prototyping tool for R&D applications.



A few words about sponsors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This activity hsa been made possible by two sponsors.

- The University of Cambridge provided financial support through a Teaching And Learning Innovation Grant to run a number of student projects and promote the use of Open Source tools in our undergraduate education.
The grant also covers part of the running costs.

- ARM and STMicroelectronics have donated the microcontrollers, one for each undergraduate. 
We hope that this arrangement will be maintained in future.

To make this activity viable on the long runs, we will need to show that the approach has been effective, i.e. that it encouraged you to gain confidence with your DIY skills.
The University and our partners will want to know what you did with your micro-controllers!




Structure and timing
--------------------

Tutorial
^^^^^^^^

This will kick off at the end of Mich 2017. 
You'll have to collect your boards, and will be encouraged to get started asap with the introductory tasks: 
watching tutorial, compilling and testing and understanding simple test code.

Christmas activity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Over the Christmas vacation and first two weeks of Lent, you will learn about more sophisticated aspects of C++ device programming, such as memory allocation, and how microcontrollers use their physical pins to directly change their behaviour.
Through a series of gradual examples, you will end up programming what might look like a proper device already!

Lent activity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Lent, weeks 3 to 8, we will give you all a temperature sensor to play with! You'll have to do a bit of soldering, read the spec sheet, and interface it with your board. You will build a simple data logger and over-heating detector.
After this, you should realise that the world is your oyster, in case you did not already. The internet is full of sensors, actuators, tutorials and spec sheets. With a bit of patience and creativity, no task will be too complex for you!
